### access control - blackle / suricrasia online ###

access control is a 4k exegfx for 64-bit linux, specifically targeting Ubuntu 18.10

Packages needed (all of these are installed by default):

libglib2.0-0
libgtk-3-0
libspectre1
and whatever package gives you libgl (depends on graphics card)

The font "DejaVu Sans Semi Condensed" is also required. This should be available by default on ubuntu.

Two versions of the demo are distributed. access_control is the size optimized, packed version. access_control_unpacked is the unpacked version that is lacking.

This exegfx will not render on resolutions lower than 1920x1080. What it produces at higher resolutions is undefined.

Exit at any moment with "esc" or with your window manager's "close window" key combo.
